# The Form of a Report

In my mind a report has four functional areas from top to bottom they are.

1. A header with information, logo, or both.
2. A body containing the data or analysis that is being conveyed.
3. A signature/date line for the appropriate sign-off.
4. A footer that is able to hold institutional information.

## What are the steps to create a report with rstudio and rmarkdown?

The first two areas to tackle are the header (1) and footer (4).

To do this we look toward the YAML.

# The Header and Footer

## What is the YAML?

From <https://yaml.org/>, YAML stand for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and 
"YAML is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".

Well, based on this I still didn't really know what YAML was.

So I looked toward <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>, where YAML is described
as the metadata for controlling certain aspects of your document.

You may recognize YAML as the extra stuff at the top of a rmarkdown file as an example.

![YAML Metadata](QC_Report1.png)\  

The YAML metadata can consist of L^AT$eX and this is where we get the greater control
over how our report will look.

## What is L^AT$eX?

From <https://www.latex-project.org/>, L^AT$eX is a document preparation system for 
high-quality typesetting of technical and scientific documentation. The most important
information for our use is there are packages available for L^AT$eX similar to R.R has 
CRAN for packages <https://cran.r-project.org/> while L^AT$eX has CTAN <https://ctan.org/>.

The information for the package we will use for our report is called _fancyhdr_ more 
information can be found at <https://ctan.org/pkg/fancyhdr?lang=en>

## Let us get started on building our report.


### Header

First we add two new sections to the YAML.

![YAML Metadata Additions](QC_Report2_1.png)\ 

The YAML metadata area has one major quirk which is spacing matters. My suggestion
is to let rstudio set the spacing and do not change it. It will cause errors when
attempting to knit which can take a while to pin down if you are not thinking about it.

geometry: will set the margins for your pdf.
header-includes: will have our header and footer information

The next thing is to add the LaTeX package to the header-includes:. We perform this by
adding ```- \usepackage{fancyhdr}```

![YAMLMetadata Add package](QC_Report2_2.png)\ 

Next we add the header information using ```- \fancyhead[]{}``` which 
has options available in the [] that include placement information L=Left, R=Right, and C=Center and
O=Odd and E=Even pages. Inside the {} is the information we are presenting on the report. In this case
we want to put our branding logo and department information.

![YAML Metadata Add header](QC_Report2_3.png)\ 

### Footer

The footer is similar to the header the only thing that is changed is head to foot ```- \fancyfoot[]{}```.

Add some data for the footer and we end up with YAML metadata that looks like the following example.

![YAML Metadata complete](QC_Report3.png)\ 

# The Signature and Date

The signature and date were add through a png image. 

## How to add an image in rmarkdown?

Insert the following into a non-code section of the rmd document ```![]()\```.
The ! indicates it is an image. The [] contain the metadata for the image. The () is the location of the image on your system. Finally, the ```\``` prevents the image from creating a "Fig #" caption on every image.

```![Signature Line](2020_AACC_2.JPG)\```

Additionally, we add some break using the following code to create space between the rest of the report and the signature line.
\hfill\break

# The Body

There are 2 parts to a rMarkdown report body.
1. Text
2. Code

The code can be split into 3 additional parts.
1. Structure Code
2. Tables
3. Figures

## The Text

The text can be placed anywhere outside of code blocks.

Remember code blocks look like 3 backticks with {} followed by 3 backticks 


### An Example

![R code block](QC_Report4.png)\ 

For this example I used a short preamble about the purpose of the report. 
There is punctuation available for the text sections for more information please 
visit <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>.

## The Code

### Structure Code

Structure code includes setting knitr options, importing the packages that will 
be used, and any other structure you may want to impose. I create a file 
structure for all my code project. Be sure to include the _include=FALSE_ option
in the code block {} for any structure code. See above for an example of this.

First I set up my knitr chunck options for a report.

```knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)```

You want to make sure that messages and warnings generated during the processing
of the code do not write to the pdf report and _echo=FALSE_ prevents the chucks 
from printing. 

The structure code used for the Basic QC Report is the following

![R code block](QC_Report5.png)\ 

### Tables and Figures

Before we can get to the tables and figures, the data used for the report needs 
to be imported and cleaned up. For this report there are two data sources a 
primary and secondary. The primary has the data that needs to be summarized and 
the secondary data contains the historically expected values for the QC.

### Import Data

To import the data into the workspace, we use read.csv or readxl::read_xlsx 
depending on the file type. I also use the _here_ and _janitor_ packages. _here_
allows one to traverse the file structure easier. _janitor_ has multiple 
functions, but the one I use the most is _clean_names()_ which standardizes the 
column names by making them all lower-case and removing special characters. 
There is one cavet if the a special character is important to identify the data 
then these tags need to be modified manually.

![R code block](QC_Report6.png)\ 

### Data Wrangling

I break data wrangling into sections so I don't forget to add something. First 
is data type transformations then tidying of the data so it is easier to use 
tidyverse functions. Then create any variables needed throughout the report (I 
update as the need arises!). Finally, I select the data I plan to use. I have 
found having this in one spot makes writing my R code more efficient. As part of
data wrangling I am constantly checking the data types with _dplyr::glimpse()_ 
and then I remove it in the final production code.

![R code block](QC_Report7.png)\ 

### Tables

The first part of the QC table code block is spent developing the data frame for
reporting. We group by the qc_code and analyte then summarizing the data from 
theprimary data set. Next we combine the primary and secondary data set using 
the _left_join()_ function and the _rename()_ function to rename columns to 
better present in a report. At this point three calculations are performed. The 
first adds to the data frame the percent Coefficient of variation for the 
calculated data (Cal. %CV). The second is the standard deviation index (SDI) 
which is calculated by subtracting the expected and calculated means then 
dividing by the expected standard deviation (SD) with an ideal value of 0. In my
mass spectrometry lab, SDI values between -0.8 to 0.8 are acceptable. The third 
calculation is the standard deviation ratio (SDR) which is calculated by 
dividing the expected SD by the calculated SD with an ideal value of 1. In my 
mass spectrometry lab, SDR values between 0.3 to 1.1 are acceptable.

![R code block](QC_Report8.png)\ 

Once that is accomplished, we move to the display and formatting of the column. 
The _knitr::kable_ function and the package _kableExtra_ will allow us to format
the table easily 90% of the time per the kableExtra website. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html> 

``` 
dt %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

This is the most basic kableExtra output with dt = datatabe, kbl() calling 
_knitr::kable_, and kable_styling() applying format. With the data we have 
processed trying some different stylings by replacing kable_styling() with one 
of the following functions.
1. _kable_paper()_
2. _kable_classic()_
3. _kable_classic2()_
4. _kable_minimal()_
5. _kable_materials()_
6. _kable_material_dark()_ --my favorite.

The _kable_styling()_ function also allows for options by adding the option 
**bootstrap_options** but many of these are more relevant to html output rather 
than pdf. _kableExtra_ also allow for the addition of a table footnote which I 
have used here to explain SDI and SDR because it is so long the option 
**threeparttable = TRUE** was used to prevent the table from rendering too 
small. Try it without and look at the resultant pdf.

![R code block](QC_Report9.png)\ 

### Figures

A basic Levey-Jennings plot was created with _dplyr::group_by_, _dplyr::mutate_,
and _ggplot_.

Please create a new code chunk for the plot and add the following code.

```
### Group, scale, and plot the data
active_data %>% 

### Group 
group_by(qc_code) %>%
   
### Scale so all the data fits on one plot
mutate(value_scaled = (value-mean(value))/sd(value)) %>%
   
### Plot the data
ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value_scaled, color = qc_code, ymin = -1, ymax = 1)) + 
   ### 1 SD range
   geom_ribbon( alpha = 0.3) +
   ### 2 SD range
   geom_ribbon(aes(ymin =-2, ymax = 2), alpha =0.2) +
   ### 3 SD range
   geom_ribbon(aes(ymin =-3, ymax = 3), alpha =0.1) +
   geom_line() + 
   geom_point() +
   ggtitle("Levey-Jennings Chart") +
   xlab("Date") +
   ylab("SD Scaled Values")
```
At this time a basic pdf QC Report can be produced by using Knit. Give it a try.


# Parameterized Reports

Have you ever wanted to modify some R code that you have but didn't want to copy
and paste then find and replace all the variables?

I have and one way to accomplish this is through parameterization. So next we 
are going to parameterize our report we just created.

Three areas will have to be modified.
1. The YAML
2. The data seletion portion of the report
3. We need to knit with parameters

## Updating the YAML

Our previous YAML should look something like this.

![R code block](QC_Report10.png)\ 

We are going to add params: to lowest layer of the YAML. This allows us to 
supply parameters to the report at the beginning of excution without having to 
do a find and replace. These parameters are stored in a varialble call "params" 
which can be access within the program using a standard R call of params$var1. 
These variable will have names that are supplied by the user when creating the 
params: section in the YAML. I created 5 variables that may be useful and set 
their default values in the params: section of the YAML. 

![R code block](QC_Report11.png)\ 

As you can see R code can also be used in the YAML with 
**"!r package::function"**. These parameters can be access within code with 
calls of _params$start_.

## Updating the data selection portion of the code

Within the data_wrangling code chuck is the code of data select.

Please try to update this section using the data stored in the params.

If everything worked out it should look something like this

![R code block](QC_Report12.png)\ 

## Knitting with parameters

To knit a parameterized document properly, you need to select the down arrow 
next to knit and select "knit with parameters" which will be the fourth option.

![R code block](QC_Report13.png)\ 

If you don't knit the document with parameters after making the parameters 
changes the R Markdown will create an error depending on what is missing. For 
this example the error is concerned with the plot.

Once "knitting with parameters" is selected, a pop-up with the parameters listed
in the parameters list. The defaults are listed there but can easily be changed.

![R code block](QC_Report14.png)\ 

The data set has testcodes CAH6 and PATY and analytes tyr = tyrosine, 
phe = phenylalanine, x17op = 17OH-progesterone, prog = progesterone, 
cortms = cortisol, doc =	deoxycorticosterone, testms = testosterone, 
andro = androstenedione, x11desc = 11-desoxycortisol, x17pre = 17OH-pregnenolone. 

Give them a try and see how the data changes.
